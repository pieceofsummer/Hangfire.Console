Inspired by AppVeyor, Hangfire.Console provides a console-like logging experience for your jobs.

## Features

 - **Provider-agnostic**: (allegedly) works with any job storage provider (currently tested with SqlServer, MemoryStorage, Redis.StackExchange and MongoDB). 
 - **100% Safe**: no Hangfire-managed data (e.g. jobs, states) is ever updated, hence there's no risk to corrupt it.
 - **With Live Updates**: new messages will appear as they're logged, as if you're looking at real console.
 - (blah-blah-blah)

## Setup

In .NET Core's Startup.cs:
```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHangfire(config =>
    {
        config.UseSqlServerStorage("connectionSting");
        config.UseConsole();
    });
}
```

Otherwise,
```c#
GlobalConfiguration.Configuration
    .UseSqlServerStorage("connectionSting")
    .UseConsole();
```

**NOTE**: If you have Dashboard and Server running separately, 
you'll need to call `UseConsole()` on both.

### Additional options

As usual, you may provide additional options for `UseConsole()` method.

Here's what you can configure:
- **ExpireIn** – time to keep console sessions (default: 24 hours)
- **FollowJobRetentionPolicy** – expire all console sessions along with parent job (default: true)
- **PollInterval** – poll interval for live updates, ms (default: 1000)
- **BackgroundColor** – console background color (default: #0d3163)
- **TextColor** – console default text color (default: #ffffff)
- **TimestampColor** – timestamp text color (default: #00aad7)

**NOTE**: After you initially add Hangfire.Console (or change the options above) you may need to clear browser cache, as generated CSS/JS can be cached by browser.

## Log

Hangfire.Console provides extension methods on `PerformContext` object, 
hence you'll need to add it as a job argument. 

**NOTE**: Like `IJobCancellationToken`, `PerformContext` is a special argument type which Hangfire will substitute automatically. You should pass `null` when enqueuing a job.  It is not currently possible to use constructor injection for the PerformContext in ASP.NET Core.

Now you can write to console:

```c#
public void TaskMethod(PerformContext context)
{
    context.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
}
```

Like with `System.Console`, you can specify text color for your messages:

```c#
public void TaskMethod(PerformContext context)
{
    context.SetTextColor(ConsoleTextColor.Red);
    context.WriteLine("Error!");
    context.ResetTextColor();
}
```

## Progress bars

Version 1.1.0 adds support for inline progress bars:

![progress](progress.png)

```c#
public void TaskMethod(PerformContext context)
{
    // create progress bar
    var progress = context.WriteProgressBar();
    
    // update value for previously created progress bar
    progress.SetValue(100);
}
```

You can create multiple progress bars and update them separately.

By default, progress bar is initialized with value `0`. You can specify initial value and progress bar color as optional arguments for `WriteProgressBar()`.

### Enumeration progress

To easily track progress of enumeration over a collection in a for-each loop, library adds an extension method `WithProgress`:

```c#
public void TaskMethod(PerformContext context)
{
    var bar = context.WriteProgressBar();
    
    foreach (var item in collection.WithProgress(bar))
    {
        // do work
    }
}
```

It will automatically update progress bar during enumeration, and will set progress to 100% if for-each loop was interrupted with a `break` instruction.

**NOTE**: If the number of items in the collection cannot be determined automatically (e.g. collection doesn't implement `ICollection`/`ICollection<T>`/`IReadOnlyCollection<T>`, you'll need to pass additional argument `count` to the extension method).
